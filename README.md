# Random Walk implemented in FreeBasic

The project aims to demonstrate an input and output of dynamic variables with a FreeBasic programming language. The dynamic variables here are the direction of dot's movement, timestamp and location coordinates.  They are get written to path.txt file dynamically during the program execution. The initial parameters are stored in parameters.txt and determine number of steps, starting location and speed. During the execution the program draws a trajectory of randomly-moving dot on a plane.
