# Random Walk implemented in FreeBasic

The project aims to demonstrate dynamic variables input and output in FreeBasic programming language. The dynamic variables here are the direction of dot's movement, timestamp and location coordinates.  They are written to path.txt file dynamically during the program execution. The initial parameters are stored in parameters.txt file and determine number of steps, starting location and speed. During the execution the program draws a trajectory of randomly-moving dot on a plane.
